## Description 

HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor
Challenge Elements
Challenges adhere to a format that’s commonly used by software development teams that use agile project management to manage their work. Practicing this will prepare you for the workflows you’ll experience as a professional full-stack web developer.  This week is an odd-numbered week, so your Challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which means you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. This week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility.

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.
